# Visual_Basic_hw1

This is the home work of my visual basic class .

Create a project for the local car rental agency that calculates rental charges.  The agency charges $49 per day plus $0.20 per mile.

Form: 
Use text boxes for the beginning odometer reading, ending odometer reading, and the number of days the car was used.  Use text boxes to display the miles driven and the total charge.  Format the output appropriately.
Include buttons for Calculate, Clear, and Exit


Code: 
Include an event procedure for each button.  For the calculation, subtract the beginning odometer reading from the ending odometer reading to get the number of miles traveled.  Use a constant for the $49 per day charge and the $0.20 mileage rate. 
Display a message to the user for any bad input data.
